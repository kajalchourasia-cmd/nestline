# Stage 10 implementation, self-verification, and capstone readiness

**Evidence status:** the Stage 10 implementation and its local integration verification are complete on the corrected Stage 5–8 foundation. Public/clinical release remains blocked by human review, released-content, and live-provider gates.

## Verdict

`STAGE 10 ACCEPTED FOR CONTROLLED ENGINEERING — CAPSTONE READY FOR INDEPENDENT REVIEW`

Equivalent release-preparation boundary: `STAGE 10 ACCEPTED FOR CONTROLLED CAPSTONE VALIDATION — RELEASE PREPARATION MAY BEGIN`.

This GO applies to a local, fictional-data, controlled capstone review. It does not authorize deployment, remote migrations, public health guidance, real clinician operations, external notifications, or use of real personal/medical data.

## Repository and entry evidence

- Corrected Stage 5–8 base: `e2a8c542648f97c9bb93d73528f2414a4f41e5c8`.
- Corrected Stage 9 checkpoint: `078b21b` on the ancestry of this branch.
- Stage 10 restored implementation checkpoint: `a044ecb8fd2be9c7986c8401367956f85bcbd3e6`.
- Integration branch: `integration/capstone-demo-final`.
- The corrected base is an ancestor of the integration branch (`git merge-base --is-ancestor` exit 0).
- Final report-bearing commit: pending until this evidence file is committed; the exact non-self-referential SHA is reported outside this commit.
- The original recovery stash remains preserved as `stash@{0}`.
- No PR, merge, force-push, deployment, remote migration, external message, notification, paid-provider call, or real patient-data operation occurred.

## Plain-language behavior

The app now has one guarded doorway for saved changes. Chat and workers can suggest a fact, task, review packet, or plan, but cannot save it directly. The authenticated user must review and explicitly submit a typed command. The State Committer checks the real session workspace, current version, provenance, consent, constraints, and allowed transition inside one database transaction.

A duplicate submission returns the original logical result. Two stale commands racing from the same version cannot both win. A material confirmed change marks only dependent plans stale and records the causal connection. Deleting a workspace clears the public product rows and private Stage 10 ledgers, so recreating a workspace cannot replay an old idempotency result.

## Requirement-to-implementation map

| Requirement | Implementation | Verification evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Single authorized write boundary | `app/services/state_committer.py`; `public.stage10_commit(uuid,jsonb)` | unit tests, 71 Stage 10 pgTAP assertions, 40 authenticated API/concurrency checks |
| Trusted authenticated scope | RPC derives caller from `auth.uid()` and checks owner membership | forged-scope, cross-workspace, anonymous and direct-write denials |
| Strict command/result contracts | `app/schemas/state_lifecycle.py`; strict SQL JSON-key and 64 KiB checks | 33 typed development cases; malformed/extra/oversized payload tests |
| Atomic versioned commits | private implementation uses a transaction, expected state version, ledgers and state increments | stale-write, rollback and three simultaneous race matrices |
| Idempotency | workspace-scoped key uniqueness plus command hash and committed response | replay, same-key/different-payload, response-loss and reset tests |
| Fact confirm/correct/reject | decision ledger, exact provenance, supersession and confirmation state | unit, pgTAP and authenticated API coverage |
| Plan lifecycle | `draft`, `user_reviewed`, `saved`, `active`, `stale`, `replaced`, `archived` | complete valid/invalid transition matrix |
| User-edit validation | Stage 8 validation disposition, source evidence, constraints and unresolved-conflict checks | unsafe edit and stale snapshot rejection cases |
| Selective staleness | normalized dependency rows and table-specific invalidation triggers | relevant-change positive and unrelated-change negative tests |
| Graph continuity | plan/fact/document nodes and causal edges | document → fact/restriction → plan item → stale plan → question story |
| Follow-ups/reminders | typed in-app tasks; reminder consent/date/time/timezone/channel; external delivery false | missing-consent/field and unavailable-delivery tests |
| Simulated review | minimal consented packet and nine-state transition graph | minimum-data, decline, timeout, unavailable, duplicate and urgent-independence tests |
| Personal/Demo persistence isolation | authenticated workspace state plus deterministic mode reset | UI, API, reset/deletion and two-principal checks |
| Clean and upgrade migrations | forward migrations `20260912000100` and `20260912000200` | clean replay and exact Stage 9 → Stage 10 upgrade, each with 325/325 pgTAP and 110/110 API checks |

## State Committer contract

Seven command kinds are supported through the one write boundary:

1. `fact_decision`;
2. `plan_create`;
3. `plan_transition`;
4. `follow_up_create`;
5. `follow_up_transition`;
6. `review_create`;
7. `review_transition`.

Every command carries a schema version, command ID, idempotency key, expected state version, timestamp, typed payload, provenance, and explicit actor/confirmation evidence where applicable. Unknown keys, oversized JSON, invalid identifiers, malformed nested objects, unsupported transitions, missing consent, stale versions, unresolved conflicts, unsafe plan content, or unauthorized scope are rejected without a partial write.

The public wrapper is executable only by `authenticated`. Its implementation function is private, has a fixed search path, and cannot be called by ordinary clients. The caller-supplied workspace is only a target to authorize; it never establishes identity. Ordinary clients and agents have read-only table access where required and cannot mutate Stage 10-owned facts, plans, items, reviews, ledgers, or dependencies directly.

## Idempotency and concurrency

The database-connected matrix used two authenticated fictional principals and independent HTTP RPC requests. It passed **26/26** checks:

- same key in different workspaces is isolated;
- exact replay and response-loss replay return the committed result;
- same key with different payload is rejected;
- concurrent plan saves: 1 committed, 1 rejected;
- fact change versus save: 1 committed, 1 rejected;
- fact change versus activate: 1 committed, 1 rejected;
- a stale retry returns current state for review;
- workspace deletion removes all checked product state;
- the other workspace remains unchanged;
- a recreated workspace cannot replay the old workspace's idempotency result.

The first implementation used SQLSTATE `40001` for an application-level stale version. PostgREST treated it as a retryable serialization failure, causing the caller to wait until timeout. Migration `20260912000200_stage10_rpc_hardening_and_reset.sql` changes this to `PT409`, preserving the conflict response while returning immediately.

## Fact confirmation and correction

Document-derived proposals retain source document, page, exact span, extraction confidence, and confirmation status. Confirm, correct, and reject are explicit user actions. Correction creates a new version and a supersession link; it never rewrites source history. Only successfully committed confirmed facts can personalize later reads. Unconfirmed, rejected, conflicting, and superseded facts remain excluded from active personalization.

## Plan lifecycle

| From | Allowed next state |
|---|---|
| `draft` | `user_reviewed`, `archived` |
| `user_reviewed` | `saved`, `draft`, `archived` |
| `saved` | `active`, `replaced`, `archived` |
| `active` | `stale`, `replaced`, `archived` |
| `stale` | `replaced`, `archived` |
| `replaced` | `archived` |
| `archived` | none |

A persisted plan contains owner/workspace, journey week and state version, creation/review timestamps, preferences, confirmed constraints, component outputs, source evidence, user edits, status, stale reason, items, and normalized dependencies. At save/activate time, current authenticated state is reloaded. A view, rerun, retry, or generated draft is never treated as review or confirmation. Stale plans remain visible but cannot be active or silently resaved.

## Dependency-driven staleness and graph continuity

Dependencies are stored for the exact journey state, allergies, restrictions, conditions, symptom state, medication/supplement records, clinician instructions, and evidence used by the plan. Relevant committed changes stale dependent plans in the same authorized transaction. Unrelated changes leave them unchanged. Missing dependency information fails visibly. No trigger regenerates, replaces, saves, or activates a plan automatically.

The connected fictional document story preserves this path:

`document → proposed/confirmed restriction → affected plan item → stale plan → professional question`

## Deletion, reset, and retention

`docs/STAGE-10-DELETION-RETENTION-INVENTORY.json` is generated from the canonical inventory and covers 13 Stage 10 state objects. The hardening migration installs a workspace-delete preparation trigger that safely removes private audit/idempotency/dependency rows and public product rows in foreign-key order while retaining unrelated workspaces. The API matrix verifies 10 public workspace-scoped tables reach zero rows, private replay becomes impossible, and the second principal is unchanged.

This is a product workspace-reset contract for controlled engineering. It is not a legal retention policy or proof of compliance; privacy/legal owners still need to set production retention periods and backup-erasure procedures.

## Follow-up, reminders, and simulated review

Follow-up tasks are in-app records with owner/workspace, provenance, status, and due information when known. A reminder requires opt-in plus date/time, timezone, and channel. External delivery remains explicitly unavailable and no notification is scheduled or sent.

Simulated review packets contain only the relevant question, journey state, minimum confirmed/user-reported context, exact evidence spans, trace, conflict, requested action, and consent record. Valid states are `not_required`, `offered`, `consented`, `queued`, `reviewed/responded`, `resumed`, `declined`, `unavailable`, and `timed_out`. Every surface says simulated. Urgent fixed guidance completes first and is independent of consent, queue state, or reviewer availability.

## Stage 9 UI integration

The Stage 9 UI routes fact decisions, plan review/save, follow-up, and simulated-review actions through the State Committer adapter. Pending, committed, rejected, stale conflict, retry-safe, offline, and unavailable states are explicit. Stable idempotency keys protect Streamlit reruns and repeated clicks. Refresh/relogin loads durable state through the storage interface; session state holds only temporary interaction state. Demo reset clears both Stage 9 and Stage 10 keys so fictional state does not leak into Personal Mode.

## One self-review and consolidated rectification

The generated self-review contains **14/14 PASS** findings. The consolidated correction:

1. preserved the single authenticated State Committer instead of restoring direct client CRUD;
2. aligned the legacy Stage 2 final-schema tests with that stricter contract while preserving all 122 assertions;
3. added strict JSON shape/size checks and fixed search paths;
4. made the private implementation non-callable by ordinary clients;
5. replaced retrying `40001` application conflicts with immediate typed `PT409` responses;
6. added real simultaneous authenticated race checks and response-loss replay;
7. completed workspace deletion across public and private Stage 10 state;
8. prevented idempotency replay after reset/recreation;
9. fixed plan provenance in API fixtures and upgrade fixtures;
10. corrected upgrade fixture fingerprint collision without changing product behavior;
11. made Demo reset remove both Stage 9 and Stage 10 temporary state;
12. kept legacy Stage 3/4 smoke assertions and navigated them through the new shell;
13. restored the expected Personal Mode product title and privacy boundary;
14. added canonical retention and self-review generators and CI coverage.

## Privacy, scope, and external-action confirmation

- All committed fixtures use fictional UUIDs, fictional names, and `example.invalid` identities.
- No raw personal text is stored in Stage 10 audit traces.
- No model or agent receives direct database write authority or service-role credentials.
- Safety and public content remain draft/unreleased and live routing stays fail-closed.
- No external review packet, reminder, notification, or message was transmitted.
- No remote migration, deployment, PR, merge, main-branch change, or paid-provider request occurred.
- The sealed final holdout was not opened.

## Remaining gates and owners

- **Kajal/product:** independent review of this integration branch and authorization to push/review.
- **Clinical and India-localisation reviewers:** qualify safety wording, routine symptom policy, and health content.
- **Licence reviewer:** approve public reuse and embedding rights.
- **Privacy/legal:** approve retention, deletion, consent, and real operational data handling.
- **Engineering/release:** run GitHub `validate` and `supabase-integration` on the exact pushed commit, then separately authorize any deployment or remote migration.
